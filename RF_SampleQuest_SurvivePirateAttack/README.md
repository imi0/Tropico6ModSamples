Contains a plain random generated map with a custom quest that spawns a pirate attack when you accept the quest and completes when you defeated the pirates.

The purpose is only to demonstrate how quests work in Tropico 6 and how you can implement custom conditions and actions in quests.

Taken from my tutorial video on Quests.
